# 🎯 Student-Score-Predictor

This project predicts a student's score based on the number of study hours using **Linear Regression**. It demonstrates a simple **machine learning model** with data visualization, training, and prediction using Python.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Student Score Predictor** is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses a dataset of student study hours and their corresponding scores.
The model learns the relationship between hours studied and performance, then predicts the score for any given number of study hours.

## 🧠 Features

* Reads data from a CSV file (`student_scores_dataset.csv`)
* Visualizes the relationship between **Hours Studied** and **Scores**
* Builds a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn
* Predicts student performance based on study time
* Evaluates model performance using R² score and Adjusted R²

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical computation
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **scikit-learn** – Machine learning

## 📂 Dataset

File: `student_scores_dataset.csv`

* Contains 100 rows of synthetic data
* Columns:

  * `Hours`: Number of study hours
  * `Scores`: Marks obtained

Example:

| Hours | Scores |
| ----- | ------ |
| 2.5   | 21     |
| 5.0   | 42     |
| 8.5   | 75     |

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Enter study hours to predict score: 2.0
Predicted Score for 2.0 study hours: 20.5
```

---

## 📈 Visualization

The regression line fits the data points, showing how scores increase with study hours:
